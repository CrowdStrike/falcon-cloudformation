# CrowdStrike Falcon CloudFormation Templates

[Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) is the [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)
platform purpose-built to stop breaches via a unified set of cloud-delivered technologies that prevent all types of
attacks â€” including malware and much more.

This repository contains sample CrowdStrike CloudFormation templates. The CloudFormation templates developed here
are examples for others to use, not an official CrowdStrike product.

## CloudFormation Templates

## Support

templates are maintained by CrowdStrike.
